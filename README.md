# Galaxy-Image-Classification
Lab 3 for ASTRON128

We analyze the efficacy of a conventional CNN (convolutional neural network) and the ResNet50 model in classifying features in galaxy images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Labels for the training data are obtained from the Galaxy Zoo 2 project (Willett et al., 2013) [4]. A validation RMSE loss of â‰ˆ 0.1 was reached for each of the models, with the ResNet50 model performing slightly better. We then use the ResNet trained models to estimate the fraction of merger galaxies at redshift z = 0, in which an upper bound fraction of around 3% was concluded. This value is within reasonable agreement with the results published by Lotz et al., 2011 [3].
